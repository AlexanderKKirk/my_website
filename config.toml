    subtitle = """I was born and raised in Long Beach, California, United States on July 5, 1998. Although it was just me to start, I would eventually 
    be joined by two brothers, Braden and Taylor. Growing up, I was a sporty, quiet, and academic child that played baseball, soccer, and flag football
    and took part in the Boy Scouts of America program, eventually achieving Scouting's highest rank. When my time in secondary school was finished, 
    I jetted across the country to attend the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia in 2016. While there, I was given incredible opportunities
    including spending a week in Bulgaria and Romania on a class trip to learn about the Crusades and spending my entire penultimate year at the 
    London School of Economics and Political Science as my study abroad. Although my ultimate year was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, I graduated
    Summa Cum Laude in May of 2020 with a bachelor of arts in Leadership Studies and a bachelor of science in business administration in Economics. 
    I also authored honors theses for both degrees, the former on a proposal for amending the American electoral system for electing the president and
    the latter on the relationship between shareholder returns and corporate social responsibility for America's largest corporations. Now, I have 
    arrived at London Business School for my Masters in Financial Analysis and to prepare for whatever comes next."""
